# Overlook Hotel Management App

## Description:

The goal of this project was to build a hotel managment tool, which could be utilized by the user(hotel staff) to manage day to day tasks. This project was a chance to further develop my skills with OOP and Test Driven Development. In addition focus on seperating my code by business vs. DOM-related code. Lastly, it was an opportunity to practice utilizing technologies like jQuery and Sass.
